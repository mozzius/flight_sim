# Flight Sim

Built using [Bevy](https://bevy.org) 0.20.

Run the game using `cargo run`

The world is procedurally generated eroded mountains (Rune Skovbo Johansen's
erosion filter), and all sound is synthesised at startup.

## Controls

Two control modes, switch with `M` (gamepad: Select):

- **Mouse aim** (default): the mouse trims pitch and rudder toward the aim
  circle; roll with A/D. Left click = gun, right click = missile.
- **Direct**: keyboard / gamepad sticks fly the plane.


- W/S or ↑/↓: pitch
- A/D or ←/→: roll
- Q/E: yaw
- Shift / Ctrl: throttle up / down (hold at the end for afterburner / airbrakes)
- Space or left mouse: gun · F or right mouse: missile (lock on first) · X: flares
- Tab / Shift+Tab: next / previous target · R or middle mouse: target nearest the crosshair
- C: look back · N: mute · Esc: release the mouse

Gamepad: left stick pitch/roll, LB/RB yaw, RT/LT throttle, A gun, B missile,
X flares, D-pad left/right cycle targets, Y or D-pad up target nearest the
crosshair, right stick look around.

Guns: put the boresight cross on the red lead pipper; it turns white with
SHOOT when you have a firing solution.

Every launch generates a new map (mountains, roads and forests). The seed is
logged at startup and shown in the pause menu; `FLIGHT_SIM_SEED=<n>` flies that
map again. The round opens with a short fly-by shot: any key, click or gamepad A skips it.

## Dev

`cargo test` runs headless flight-model tests.

`FLIGHT_SIM_SCREENSHOT=out.png cargo run` saves a screenshot after 5 seconds
(`FLIGHT_SIM_SCREENSHOT_AFTER=<secs>` to change) and exits. Other switches:
`FLIGHT_SIM_LOG=1` (FPS + flight state each second), `FLIGHT_SIM_AUTOPILOT=1`
(the AI flies your jet), `FLIGHT_SIM_FX_TEST=1` (afterburner + an explosion),
`TERRAIN_DEBUG_CAM=1..4` (terrain viewpoints), `FLIGHT_SIM_FX_TEST=explosion|engines|missile|vapour|...`
(staged effects), `CLOUDS_DEBUG_CAM=above|below|inside|sun|horizon`, `CLOUDS_DIV=2..4` (cloud
resolution divisor: 4 is cheapest, 2 is crispest), `FLIGHT_SIM_NO_CLOUDS=1`, `FLIGHT_SIM_PAUSE_TEST=1`, `FLIGHT_SIM_KILL_TEST=1`,
`FLIGHT_SIM_NO_INTRO=1`, `FLIGHT_SIM_SEED=<n>` (fixed map; otherwise random).
Screenshot runs are headless (no window) and silent.

## Web build

Live at <https://flight.mozzius.dev> (needs a WebGPU browser). Build and deploy:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli --version 0.2.130  # match wasm-bindgen in Cargo.lock
./scripts/build-web.sh                            # -> dist/
vercel deploy dist --prod --scope samuel-newmans-projects --project flight-sim
```

The web build is single-threaded, so it bakes the terrain textures at half
resolution and plants trees a couple of chunks per frame; startup still freezes
the page for ~15 s while the terrain generates.
